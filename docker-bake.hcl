# Dockerfile, so a change to a key invalidates no layer cache, and a
# fork that builds the Dockerfile on its own does not claim to be this
# repository's image.

# SOURCE is the repository's URL, REVISION the commit, VERSION the
# release or development version, and CREATED the commit's committer
# time in RFC 3339. A local build leaves them empty, and an empty key
