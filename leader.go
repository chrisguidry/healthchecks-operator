package main

// Two replicas of the operator run at once, and one of them, the
// leader, does the work. The leader holds a Lease in the operator's
// namespace and renews it every retry period. A standby tries for the
// Lease every retry period, and takes it when its holder released it,
// or when it has not changed for a whole lease duration. The standby
// measures that duration with its own clock from when it first read
// the Lease as it is, so a clock that disagrees with the leader's
// cannot make a Lease look expired early.
//
// A leader that cannot renew for the renew deadline stops its work and
// goes back to waiting as a standby. Its next term runs a new
// controller, so nothing from the old term's memory carries over. The
// process does not exit, because the kubelet would count each lost
// Lease as a crash and delay the restarts. The renew deadline is shorter than
// the lease duration, so the leader stops before a standby can take
// the Lease. A Lease is not a lock, though: a leader that the scheduler
// pauses past the deadline, or a probe that is in flight when the work
// stops, can still send a ping beside the new leader's. Every ping the
// operator sends is safe to send twice except a cronJob check's report
// of one Job, which the new leader can send again before the old one's
// status write lands.
//
// The defaults are client-go's, from k8s.io/client-go/tools/leaderelection.
